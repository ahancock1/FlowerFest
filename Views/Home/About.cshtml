    <h1>About FlowerFest</h1>

    <p class="lead-lg">
        My inspiration came after a visit i made to the annual flower festival in Girona, Spain.
        <br/>
        'Temps de Flors' has grown year on year (now 61 years), and is the biggest revenue provider for Girona. The streets are lined with retailers and businesses showcasing their own creativity and ingenuity. From a small plant pot to the more elaborate window display of floral art, it is a feast for the eyes and senses. With local participation being key to its success it has become known as a commuinity with floaral focus.
        <br/>
        Walking the streets of Girona, it dawned on me that Christchurch would be the perfect venue for our own flower festival in Dorset, and give an opportunity to focus on an area of health that is proven to improve by working with nature, the area of, Mental Health and Well-being.
